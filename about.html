      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>I'm a student in the AI-Native program with a journey that started far from Silicon Valley. Originally from Russia, I've called NYC home since 2005.</p>

      <p>My tech story began unexpectedly in 2017 when I landed a nutritionist role at Plated, a food tech company. Working in that environment opened my eyes to how technology could revolutionize industries I was passionate about.</p>

      <p>After a few years at Plated, I decided to pivot and learn how to code. I joined Pursuit's iOS developer program (the same amazing school where I'm now diving into AI), which led me to work as an iOS developer at Twitter.</p>

      <p>Now I'm back at Pursuit exploring how AI is transforming development and learning to build smarter, more efficient solutions.</p>

      <p>When I'm not experimenting with AI tools or coding, you'll find me in the kitchen, planning my next travel adventure, or trying to convince my 16-year-old son that AI could revolutionize his homework process (still working on that one).</p>

      <p>Oh, and yes—that's my cat photobombing the my GitHub link. He insisted on being part of my AI-powered developer journey.</p>

      <p>Currently learning: How to leverage AI for web development, prompt engineering, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and discovering new ways AI can enhance every step of the development process.</p>
